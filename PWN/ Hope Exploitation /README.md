Challenge: Hope Exploitation

- Vulnerability: heap use-after-free / XOR-obfuscated heap pointers leak.
- Goal: recover a heap pointer (xored), recover the XOR key, compute flag address,
  overwrite an entry to point to the flag and read it.

Approach:
- The solver performs create/delete/view choreography to leak an XORed heap pointer
  and the XOR key, recovers the real heap address, computes the flag's address,
  and overwrites a pointer to cause the program to print the flag.

Notes:
- `solve.py` contains inline comments explaining the XOR steps, offsets, and edits.
