# Challenge Name : The Silent Document
## Difficulty : Easy 
## File : `challenge.pdf`

----------------------------------------------------

- It is useless to open the pdf file there is no flag in there buddy hihi :>

- The flag is hidden inside the document but it's not obvious of course, we're gonna use a tool called `pdftotext` to **convert the pdf into text** and see what it hides.

```bash
pdftotext challenge.pdf -
```

And you're done easy right :> , it's solvable also by an online converter but i recommend this method better
