The word originates from Greek, meaning "covered writing."

Modern digital steganography embeds data within images, audio files, videos, or text by making subtle alterations that are imperceptible to human senses but detectable with proper analysis. Common techniques include least significant bit (LSB) modification in images, phase coding in audio, and whitespace manipulation in text. The effectiveness of steganography depends on the carrier medium's capacity to hide data without raising suspicion.

Applications range from legitimate uses like digital watermarking and copyright protection to covert communications and data exfiltration. Detection methods, called steganalysis, employ statistical analysis to identify anomalies that suggest hidden content. As both hiding and detection techniques evolve, steganography remains a critical area in information security and digital forensics.
